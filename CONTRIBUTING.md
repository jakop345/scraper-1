CONTRIBUTING
============

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:


Types of Contributions
======================

Report Bugs
-----------
Have a conference you'd like to add? Please create an issue with:

* The name of the event to add (the conference name, the user group name, etc).
* A description of the event.
* Any urls where we can find additional details about the thing.
* The url for the video material.
* If it exists: urls for transcripts of the videos, slides of the presentations, etc.

Write Documentation
-------------------

Our documentation can always be better. What questions did you have that you
think other people might have that aren't answered in the documentation? Were
you able to find what you were looking for? Was documentation in weird
unexpected places? Are there typos? Are examples helpful? Are examples missing?

We could always use more documentation whether that's part of the official
docs, comments and docstrings in the code or even elsewhere on the web in blog
posts, articles, tweets and other things like that.


Making PR's
===========
When making a PR, if there's a merge conflict please do not merge master.
Instead rebase your PR and deal with the conflicts. This will also allow you to
squash "fixup" types of commits as well. For some documentation on how to
rebase in git please see:

* https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/
* https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages
* http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html

This does mean that you'll have to force push your branch but that's OK as long
as you're not working with several people on the same branch. If you are, then
more coordination is required.
